        <h3>What Is The Problem</h3>
        <div class="chapter-content">
            <p>Data inequality is a widespread issue with serious implications for society. Misrepresentation of different demographics affects the accuracy of predictions and fairness in decision-making.</p>
            <p>For years, Data Scientists ignored the inherent flaws in data collection, often attributing errors to respondents or external factors rather than examining their own biases.</p>
            <p>Today, Data Scientists are beginning to recognize these issues and take action, though there are still many issues that need resolving.</p>
        </div>
        <button onclick="toggleContent(this)">Uncover the Problem</button>
    </div>

    <div class="chapter">
        <h3>Case Study</h3>
        <div class="chapter-content">
            <p>One key example of data inequality is found in healthcare systems. Optum, a health services company, once used an algorithm to predict healthcare needs, but it was biased.</p>
            <p>The algorithm wrongly assumed that black patients were healthier than equally sick white patients because it used healthcare spending as a metric. This bias stemmed from the fact that black patients tend to spend less on healthcare due to systemic poverty.</p>
            <p>Once identified, the algorithm was corrected to use more accurate health indicators, improving healthcare recommendations for minority patients. </p>

        <h3>What More Can Be Done</h3>
        <div class="chapter-content">
            <p>Data inequality is not just a technical issue but one that stems from deeper societal factors:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Data collection often over-represents wealthier and predominantly white populations.</li>
                <li>The lack of diversity in Data Science teams exacerbates biases, as teams from similar backgrounds may fail to recognize issues affecting marginalized groups.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These issues lead to models that don't represent the full range of human experience and leave vulnerable groups at a disadvantage.</p>

    <div class="chapter">
        <h3>Concrete Solutions</h3>
        <div class="chapter-content">
            <p>To combat data inequality, Data Scientists must focus on achievable goals that can address the root causes. Here are two SMART goals that can guide change:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="goal-container" style="display:none;">
            <h4>Goal 1: Increase Diversity in Data Science Teams</h4>
            <p><strong>Specific:</strong> Increase the diversity of data science teams by recruiting at least 10% of new hires from underrepresented groups.</p>
            <p><strong>Measurable:</strong> Track the percentage of new hires from diverse backgrounds to ensure a more balanced team.</p>
            <p><strong>Achievable:</strong> Partner with diversity-focused agencies and attend diverse career fairs to attract candidates.</p>
            <p><strong>Relevant:</strong> Diverse teams are more likely to identify and address biases in data, leading to fairer models.</p>
            <p><strong>Time-bound:</strong> Achieve this goal within 5 years to allow time for recruitment and change.</p>
        </div>
        <button onclick="toggleContent(this)">See the First Solution</button>
        <div class="goal-container" style="display:none;">
            <h4>Goal 2: Improve Data Collection Practices</h4>
            <p><strong>Specific:</strong> Revise data collection protocols to ensure more inclusive and representative data, particularly in healthcare and finance.</p>
            <p><strong>Measurable:</strong> Monitor the demographic composition of datasets to ensure no group is underrepresented.</p>
            <p><strong>Achievable:</strong> Implement outreach programs to engage underrepresented communities and ensure access to data collection tools.</p>
            <p><strong>Relevant:</strong> Inclusive data is essential for building unbiased, equitable models.</p>
            <p><strong>Time-bound:</strong> Achieve a 10% representation target for underrepresented groups within the next 2 years.</p>
        </div>
        <button onclick="toggleContent(this)">See the Second Solution</button>
    </div>

    <div class="chapter">
        <h3>Implementation</h3>
        <div class="chapter-content">
            <p>To implement these solutions, Data Scientists must be aware that they don't come easy. Though they are not meant to change everything about data collection and analysis, people must be flexible and willing to adapt.</p>
            <p>The solutions above work because it highlights the core issues (bias in data science teams and data collection) and provides concrete steps to address them. If teams follow the steps layed out, they can look to limit the impact of Data Biases within their companies. </p>
            <p>By embracing these goals, the Data Science community can move towards fairer, more inclusive practices. As these changes are implemented, we can ensure that all populations are fairly represented and served by data-driven decisions.</p>
        </div>
        <button onclick="toggleContent(this)">Why This Works</button>
    </div>

    <div class="chapter">
        <h3> Who Is This For</h3>
        <div class="chapter-content">
            <p>The goal of this solution is to speak to you, tech industry leaders/companies, who hold control of what data collection their particular industries can hold.</p>
            <p>Only you have the power to help change the data industry. Without hiring and instilling a common data collection practice that looks to include under-represented groups, your companies will continue to produce incorrect data and as such will be unable to solve the problems of tomorrow.</p>
            <p>By implementing the solutions suggested above, you create a new culture with data science, giving those who are normally not given a platform, a space to speak, thereby creating products <strong>for the user by the user</strong></p>
